Courses Review is a user-friendly system designed to assist students in the process of selecting elective courses. The website offers a platform that aggregates all reviews for various courses and calculates a weighted rating for each course based on several parameters that are most important to students. Any student can register on the site and submit reviews of elective courses based on their personal experience.
